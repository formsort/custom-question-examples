# Auto-height

This example uses the statically-hosted custom-question API (available on unpkg) to demonstrate how you can call `setQuestionSize` to update the size of the question in Formsort.

## Usage

This example uses the statically published Formsort custom question api, and is hosted on GitHub pages at https://formsort.github.io/custom-question-examples/auto-height/index.html if you'd like to include it within a Formsort flow.

If you want to customize it, you'd need to host a version of the HTML, or something you build using [@formsort/custom-question-api](https://github.com/formsort/oss/tree/master/packages/custom-question-api)
